## Task List

I created this project to practice working with Vue.js. It is a task list where you can add/close/remove tasks, and set priorities/sort those tasks.

## How to Use It

Open the file `index.html`. You can start adding new tasks by clicking the 'Add Task' button. A priority indicator, an input box, and a 'Mark As Done' button will appear. A default priority of 5 is given to the task. You can click on the number to increase the importance of the task.

You can sort all tasks by clicking the 'Sort By Priority' button. This will organize the tasks starting from 1, ending with 5. Note that completed tasks are still included in the sort.

You can mark a task as complete by clicking 'Mark As Done'. You can then leave the task there for self-satisfaction, re-open it by clicking 'Re-open' in case you need to edit it, or click 'Remove' to clear it from the list.

## Future Versions

Planned future releases will include:
* Ability to add more in-depth descriptions
* Ability to add subtasks
* Persistence (Read/Write tasks from a file)
* Ability to add an expiration date/time to tasks
